# Memory Card Game

This is project which implements a game where you can click on an image only once. If an already clicked image is clicked again then score reduces to zero.

In this project I learn basics of hooks and how hooks provide stateful logic to functional components which was not possible earlier. I used two major hooks in this project, State hook and Effect hook.

You can play the game by clicking on the link provided in the right side in About section.
